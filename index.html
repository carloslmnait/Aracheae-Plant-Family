                        <p>Aroids are very easy to care for. The Araceae plant family prefer an environment with moderate humidity and shady environments since they are primarily in rain forests, in the home of tropical climates; most of these plants prefer indirect light and can tolerate up to medium light. As they prefer a moist environment, caring for aroids indoors only needs watering at least once a week. </p>
